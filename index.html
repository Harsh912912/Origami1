        There Is Some Fect About Camel
        <ul>
            <li>Camels can reach 7 feet in height (at the hump) and weigh up to 1500 pounds</li>
            <li>They are specially adapted to the life in desert. Their eyes have three eyelids and two rows of eyelashes that prevent sand to enter their eyes.</li>
            <li>Camel&#39;s ears are furry. Hairs keep the sand and dust away from their ears. Besides ears and eyes, their nostrils prevent the sand from entering by closing in between two breaths.</li>
        </ul>
